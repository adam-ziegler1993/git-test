This is Adam's first git project!
Here's some useful terms:

"git status" checks the status of the untracked, staged, and committed projects.

"git add <file_name>" adds the project to staged.

"git add ." adds all the untracked projects into the stage area. 

"git commit -m <file_name>" commits the project to the repository before
pushing to the origin master. 

"git log" shows what you've done so far.

"git push origin master" uploads work done to repository at GitHub.
